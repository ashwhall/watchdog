# Batch Telegram Notifications Update

## Summary of Changes

This update modifies the Watchdog application to send all Telegram notifications at the end of scraping instead of incrementally during the scraping process. Messages are now spaced 500ms apart to avoid rate limiting.

## Modified Files

### 1. `/lib/scraper-utils.ts`
- **Added**: Notification queue system with `notificationQueue` array
- **Modified**: `saveDogs()` now queues notifications instead of sending them immediately
- **Added**: `sendQueuedTelegramNotifications()` function that sends all queued notifications with 500ms delays
- **Added**: `queueTelegramNotifications()` helper function

### 2. `/scripts/scrape-all.ts`
- **Added**: Import for `sendQueuedTelegramNotifications`
- **Added**: Call to `sendQueuedTelegramNotifications()` at the end of scraping if new dogs were found

### 3. `/scripts/facebook-scrape-all.ts`
- **Added**: Import for `sendQueuedTelegramNotifications`
- **Added**: Call to `sendQueuedTelegramNotifications()` at the end of Facebook scraping

### 4. `/lib/simple-scheduler.ts`
- **Added**: Import for `sendQueuedTelegramNotifications`
- **Modified**: Both scheduled and initial scraping jobs now call `sendQueuedTelegramNotifications()` after completion

### 5. `/scripts/demo-telegram.ts`
- **Added**: Import for `sendQueuedTelegramNotifications`
- **Modified**: Demo now sends queued notifications at the end

### 6. `/scripts/test-batch-notifications.ts` (NEW)
- **Added**: New test script to verify the batch notification system

### 7. `/package.json`
- **Added**: `telegram:test-batch` script command

## How It Works

1. **During Scraping**: When dogs are saved via `saveDogs()`, they are added to a notification queue instead of triggering immediate notifications
2. **After Scraping**: The main scraping scripts call `sendQueuedTelegramNotifications()` which:
   - Sends individual notifications for each dog with 500ms delays between messages
   - Sends a batch summary notification if multiple dogs were found
   - Clears the notification queue after sending

## Benefits

- **Better Rate Limiting**: 500ms delays between messages prevent Telegram rate limiting
- **Cleaner User Experience**: All notifications arrive together at the end instead of scattered throughout the scraping process
- **Improved Performance**: Scraping isn't slowed down by notification sending
- **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features preserved, just with better timing

## Testing

Run the new test script to verify the batch notification system:
```bash
npm run telegram:test-batch
```

## Migration Notes

- The old `sendTelegramNotifications()` function is preserved for backward compatibility but is no longer used
- All existing scripts and scheduled jobs automatically use the new batch system
- No configuration changes required - the system works with existing Telegram settings
